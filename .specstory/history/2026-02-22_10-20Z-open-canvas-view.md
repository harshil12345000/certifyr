# Open canvas view (2026-02-22 10:20Z)

_**User**_

@.superdesign/ open canvas view

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Considering user prompt**

The user's request is very brief, which makes me think they might just be looking to open something quickly. Typically, to work with .pen designs, I’d start with Pencil MCP using `get_editor_state`. However, the system rules say I need to check the tool schema first via Read. Since they mentioned "open canvas view" in the .superdesign directory, they might want to open a specific .pen file or start a new design. I should explore the .superdesign directory with Glob or Read while remembering that I can't read the contents of the .pen files directly since they're encrypted.
**Clarifying file handling**

I realize my tools for file listing involve functions like Glob, not the "ls" command from CLAUDE, which was intended for VS Code extensions. But I'm inclined to follow similar high-level ideas for UI design, focusing on the superdesign workflow. The user request is to "open canvas view," which likely means using `open_document` for a .pen file or a new document. They mentioned the "@.superdesign/" folder, suggesting they might want that folder opened in the canvas. To proceed, I need to check the descriptors in the specified directory using functions like Read or Glob. However, it's important to remember that I shouldn't run ApplyPatch in parallel with other tools.
**Planning tool usage**

The user specified a concise response, so I need to create a short plan before using any tools. It seems the task involves "opening a .pen design file" with MCP using `open_document`. They didn't mention a specific file, but I can check the active .pen using `get_editor_state`. If nothing is open, I might open a new document in .superdesign. Before anything, I must read the tool schema using Read from the tool descriptor JSON. I’ve got two possible locations for tool descriptors to consider, and I can access the required path using Read, ensuring I respect backslashes.
**Understanding tool interactions**

I need to keep in mind that when calling tools, I must use the actual tool calls instead of just stating what I called. While I'm aware of the guidelines from CLAUDE.md, we don't have those specific tools here; instead, I have functions like Write. The user wants to open the canvas view in .superdesign, but since I can't open a UI directly, the best option is to open the relevant .pen document in Pencil. This action would reflect as an open canvas in the extension. I need to find out what .pen files exist, but `open_document(filePathOrNew)` might also accept "new," and the user referenced `@.superdesign/` without mentioning a specific file.
**Planning file exploration**

I should first check for any existing .pen files by using `user-pencil.get_editor_state`. If there's an active document in .superdesign, the canvas is already open, but since the user requested "open canvas view," it likely means nothing is active. I interpret this as needing to open a design document or create a new one if none exist. To proceed, I'll start by using Glob to list the .pen files in the `.superdesign` directory. This will help me choose an appropriate file to open. Following that, I plan to read the MCP tool descriptors. Although I'm limited by schema in calling tools, I can start by checking the directory contents and summarizing my findings for the user. I'll give a concise plan before I begin.</details></think>

I'll first inspect the `.superdesign` folder to see what design/canvas files are available so I can tell you how to open or work with them.

Looks like `.superdesign` currently only contains `design_iterations/default_ui_darkmode.css` and no dedicated canvas/design file (like `.html` or `.pen`) to open in a “canvas view”.

### What you can do now

- **If you meant opening a visual design canvas (Superdesign / Pencil):**  
  There isn’t a design document yet, only a theme CSS. We’d need to first create a UI design file (e.g. an HTML mockup or a `.pen` file) to have something to open on a canvas.  
  - Tell me what you want to design (e.g. “AI dashboard screen”, “landing page hero”, etc.), and I’ll follow the Superdesign workflow (layout → theme → animation → HTML in `.superdesign/design_iterations/...`) so you can then view it visually.

- **If you meant just opening the `.superdesign` folder/files in Cursor:**  
  Open the folder `/.superdesign/design_iterations` in your sidebar and then open `default_ui_darkmode.css`. I can also generate a new HTML design file there for you if you tell me what screen you want.
